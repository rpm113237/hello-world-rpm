# hello-world-rpm
this is following through the GitHub tutorial.  "Read the Directions"
This excercise is because I REALLY need to be able to edit Soil Moisture both on the Rpi
and the more convenient Windows Desktop.
Innovation (or reading the instructions) takes place when there is no other alternative.

Finally figured out how to edit this file.  This is being done on Rpi.  See if we can get a commit message
